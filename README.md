# AgglomerativeClustering-Model
The agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is a popular example of HCA. To group the datasets into clusters, it follows the bottom-up approach. It means, this algorithm considers each dataset as a single cluster at the beginning, and then start combining the closest pair of clusters together. It does this until all the clusters are merged into a single cluster that contains all the datasets.

This hierarchy of clusters is represented in the form of the dendrogram.
